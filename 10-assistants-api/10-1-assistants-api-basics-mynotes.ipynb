    "- Software development\n",
    "- Content creation\n",
    "- Data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: A developer integrates an assistant into a navigation app that understands natural language queries like “Find the nearest petrol pump.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 🔄 Task Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "Assistants can automate tasks such as:\n",
    "- Data processing\n",
    "- Feedback analysis\n",
