    "# ASSISTANTS API\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the Assistants API from Azure OpenAI to create and interact with a custom AI assistant. The Assistants API enables the creation and management of conversational assistants with specific instructions and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps Covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assistant Creation: Define a new assistant by specifying its custom instructions and selecting a model. Tools like the Code Interpreter are enabled to enhance the assistant's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Thread Creation: Initialize a new conversation thread where interactions with the assistant will take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Message Addition: Send messages to the thread, simulating user queries or prompts that the assistant will respond to.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Running the Assistant: Execute the assistant on the thread to generate responses based on the provided instructions and user inputs. The notebook handles the response retrieval and displays the text content.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Chat Completions API needs the full conversation to be passed as the body to OpenAI for getting the context but in Assitant API we just need to pass assitant id and thread id."
