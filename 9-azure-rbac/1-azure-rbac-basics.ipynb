    "# 📘 Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Technical Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a fundamental security mechanism in Microsoft Azure that enables fine-grained access management for Azure resources. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the RBAC model, its components, and how it governs access control in Azure environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 What is Azure RBAC?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RBAC** stands for **Role-Based Access Control**. It is a system that allows administrators to assign permissions to users, groups, and applications based on their roles within an organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence:\n",
    "- **Roles** define **what** actions can be performed.\n",
    "- **Security principals** define **who** can perform those actions.\n",
    "- **Scopes** define **where** those actions can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Core Components of Azure RBAC\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure RBAC is built around **three key artifacts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. 👤 Security Principal (**Who**)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **security principal** is an identity that can be assigned access to Azure resources. This represents the **\"who\"** in the RBAC model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Security Principals:\n",
    "- **User**: An individual user account.\n",
    "- **Group**: A collection of users managed as a single entity.\n",
    "- **Service Principal**: An identity for applications or services to access Azure resources securely.\n",
    "- **Managed Identity**: An automatically managed identity for Azure services.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔎 **Service Principal**: Think of it as a user account for applications. It allows apps to authenticate and access resources securely without user intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Use Case:\n",
    "In a team with developers, IT admins, DB admins, and security admins, each role requires different levels of access. Security principals help segregate duties and enforce least privilege access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 📜 Role Definition (**What**)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **role definition** specifies **what** actions a security principal can perform. It is essentially a collection of permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Built-in Roles:\n",
    "- **Owner**: Full access to all resources, including the ability to assign roles.\n",
    "- **Contributor**: Can create, read, update, and delete resources but **cannot** assign roles.\n",
    "- **Reader**: Can view resources but **cannot** make changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Permissions Include:\n",
    "- **Read**\n",
    "- **Write**\n",
    "- **Delete**\n",
    "- **Specific resource actions**\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Important Distinction**: A **Contributor** can manage resources but **cannot** manage access or assign roles, unlike an **Owner**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. 🌍 Scope (**Where**)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope** defines **where** the access applies. It determines the boundaries within which the role definition is effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Levels of Scope:\n",
    "- **Management Group**\n",
    "- **Subscription**\n",
    "- **Resource Group**\n",
    "- **Resource**\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔁 **Hierarchy**: Azure RBAC follows a **top-down inheritance model**. Permissions assigned at a higher level (e.g., subscription) are automatically inherited by lower levels (e.g., resource group, resource).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 Role Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the **who**, **what**, and **where** are defined, the final step is to **attach** the role to the security principal. This process is called **Role Assignment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role Assignment = Security Principal + Role Definition + Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "- **Security Principal**: Marketing Group\n",
    "- **Role Definition**: Contributor\n",
    "- **Scope**: Former Sales Resource Group\n",
    "\n",
    "> ✅ This means users in the Marketing Group can manage resources **only** within the Former Sales Resource Group. They **cannot** access resources outside this scope unless explicitly assigned another role.\n",
    "\n",
